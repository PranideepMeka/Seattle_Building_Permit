A sample Data Visualization Report 
🏗️ Seattle Building Permits – Data Visualization Practice
This project involves a basic visualization of Seattle’s building permit data extracted from a PDF source. The goal was to practice visualizing permit-related metrics, rather than to perform a comprehensive data wrangling or modeling task.

📄 Dataset Source
The data is derived from a report on Seattle’s building permits (PDF). It includes permit types such as Demolition, permit categories (e.g., Commercial, Single Family, etc.), values, application dates, applicant names, and statuses.

⚙️ Data Preparation Notice
Please note the following simplifications and limitations in data preparation:

🧹 Data Wrangling steps were not fully refined; this was not the primary focus of the exercise.

🧼 Imputation Technique: Only the mode was used to fill missing values.

🚫 All remaining null values were dropped after mode imputation.

📉 Data cleaning, normalization, and detailed feature engineering were not thoroughly implemented.

📊 Key Metrics Highlighted
Number of permits by year and month.

Category distribution (e.g., Single Family, Commercial, etc.).

Highest valued permit applications.

Average and maximum permit values.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python (Pandas)

Jupyter Notebook,Powe BI

Data extracted manually from PDF for practice

⚠️ This project is for educational and practice purposes only. The data preparation is intentionally minimal to focus on learning visualization techniques.
